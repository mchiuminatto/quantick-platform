What is the best deployment in AWS for a web application that hast he following features:

- Clients will upload large data files wiuth price time series and signals
- The system will take the file and applyu process and produce an output file. This may take time and needs to be done asynchronously.
- The client can download the produced file.
- Once the file is downloaded willbe deleted from the system

Architeture

- The system needs to be deployed in AWS
- The system need to be conteinarized for horizontal scaling
- Use a microservice architecture


Infrastructure
-  infrstructure as code 


Tech Stack
- Python
- Django
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL

Constraints

- Use the AWS free tier



# Architecture Overview
## Frontend:

Amazon S3: Use S3 to serve static assets, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, directly if your application provides a static front end.
AWS CloudFront: Optional, for CDN distribution which can cache your content globally ensuring low-latency access.

## API / Backend Microservices:

AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate: Use ECS with Fargate to run your containerized microservices (Django and FastAPI). Fargate allows you to run containers without managing servers directly, and it fits into the free tier up to certain usage limits.
Alternatively, for maximum free tier usage, AWS EC2 (t2.micro instance) could host your Docker containers, though this involves more hands-on management.
File Upload and Processing:

Amazon S3: Use S3 for clients to upload large files and to store processed output files temporarily.
AWS Lambda: Use Lambda functions to trigger processing tasks when files are uploaded to S3. This is cost-effective, especially for event-driven tasks within the free tier limits.
AWS Step Functions: Orchestrate longer-running processes if required. Step Functions offer a limited number of free tier executions per month.
Data Storage:

Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL): Use the free tier offering of RDS to run a PostgreSQL database for storing metadata and other application data. Limit usage to fit within the database instance free tier limits.
Asynchronous Processing:

AWS SQS: Use Amazon Simple Queue Service for managing asynchronous processing tasks or job queues. SQS has a generous free tier that can help manage message queuing.
Client Notifications and Download:

Use S3 to provide temporary pre-signed URLs for secure file download, which automatically expires after a certain period.
Upon download, use S3 event notifications or Lambda to trigger cleanup processes that delete the files.
Infrastructure as Code:

AWS CloudFormation: Utilize CloudFormation to define and deploy your infrastructure as code. Ensure all your resources are optimized for the free tier.
Alternatively, AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) or Terraform can provide additional flexibility, although Terraform will require additional knowledge about managing state separately.
Tech Stack Integration
Containers: Use Docker to containerize both Django (for backend management/UI if needed) and FastAPI (for handling file uploads and asynchronous processing tasks).
Sample Docker Configuration:

## Create a Dockerfile for Django and FastAPI services.
Dockerfile Example:

```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set work directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . /app

# Expose port and run
EXPOSE 8000  # Example for Django
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "myproject.wsgi:application"]  # For Django
```


## Deployment Strategy

CI/CD: Implement CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, both of which offer a free tier.
Cost Management: Monitor AWS service usage closely to ensure it stays within the free tier limits. Set up AWS Budgets to alert you when usage approaches or exceeds limits.
Considerations for the Free Tier
Ensure that all computational tasks are optimized to run as quickly and efficiently as possible to stay within AWS free tier limits.
Regularly clean up unused resources and monitor S3 storage usage as it can quickly exceed the free tier capacity if files are not managed properly.
Be aware of data transfer costs, especially if files are large, as these can exceed free tier limits quickly.

# Conclusion

This architecture outlines a cost-effective manner to deploy a scalable, containerized web application on AWS using the specified tech stack while adhering to AWS free tier constraints. It leverages managed services to reduce the complexity of infrastructure management and focuses on optimizing resource usage to remain within free tier thresholds.
